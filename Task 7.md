🔹 What is SPECKit Plus? 

SPECKit Plus is a lightweight framework designed to help students clearly understand and organize AI-based or software development workflows. It breaks a system into simple, structured parts so that planning, designing, and implementation become easier. SPECKit Plus ensures that every project starts with clear rules, clear specifications, a proper plan, defined tasks, and a smooth implementation process.


🔹 Core Concepts:

1️⃣ /constitution:

The constitution defines the foundational rules, boundaries, goals, and values of the system. It sets the “guiding principles” that the project must follow and ensures the system behaves as expected.


2️⃣ /specify:

This step describes what the system should do in detail. It includes the problem statement, target users, use cases, main features, expected outputs, and overall system requirements.


3️⃣ /plan:

The planning section lays out how the system will be built. It includes the roadmap, step-by-step flow, architecture outline, and the sequence of actions needed to complete the project.


4️⃣ /tasks:

This includes all actionable items required to build the system. Each task is clear, small, and executable — helping break the project into manageable steps for development.


5️⃣ /implement:

The implementation stage focuses on actually building and running the system. It includes coding, using tools, integrating components, testing, debugging, and preparing the final working solution.
